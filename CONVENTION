CONVENTIONS FOR INTERFACE AND FILE NAMES

1   Top-level interface definitions have names ending in 'I' and
    are in similarly named files.  So the acceptor abstraction is
    defined as an interface named AcceportL and stored in a file
    acceptorL.go.

2   Implementations for interfaces are in subdirectories.  These
    may have the base name as the interface.  So for example 
    there is an overlay/ subdirectory.

3   Lower level abstractions follow the same pattern.  So IP overlays
    have an interface named IPOverlayL.  File names are generally
    camel-cased but shortened where possible, so this is defined in 
    overlay/ip_overlayL.go.  IP v4 overlay implementations will be defined 
    below that, so the file structure includes
        xlattice_go
            overlayI.go                 // interface
            overlay/
                overlay.go              // Overlay struct
                ip_overlaysI.go         // interface
                ip/
                    v4/
